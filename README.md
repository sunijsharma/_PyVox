YouTube and Soundcloud playback bot for Discord. Supports some other websites as well.  
Feel free to contribute, I appreciate any help I can get.

## Installation

Use pip installations first

```
pip install git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@async
```

```
pip install youtube-dl
```

Then, install [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).
This bot requires [opus](https://www.opus-codec.org/downloads/) to work. If on windows , put the opus .dll into the same folder as the bot file.

## Usage
Run PyVox by using the command line arguments:

```
python pyvox.py bot_email bot_password
```
Replace `bot_email` and `bot_password` with the bot's email and passwords respectively.

Commands are run by mentioning the bot followed by the command:

```
@Bot init
```
Bot = the bot's username
